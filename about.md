I recently graduated from UC San Francisco with a PhD in Biomedical informatics. My thesis focused on developing new statistical methods and data models for representing single cell RNA-seq data. The work borrowed from image processing, Natural Language Processing, and other engineering/computational fields. Contrary to the image shown, my work is purely computational.

For my undergraduate degree, I studied Electrical Engineering at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
